# Notes

## finish up:
- breakdown each section into its own page
- make sure left-side takes all space on the left
    - could be solved with media queries??
- add separation between sections
- add logs for browser console
- add deploy branch for github

## things to do/improve:
- when the right-side moves to the bottom:
    - add a media query so that
        - profile-overview is in the center in this layout
            - memoji
            - name
            - title
- sticky top navbar with links to
    - welcome
        - default
        - like a welcome, get to know me, and fun page
        - this page will continue to have the profile-overiew
    - resume (move all my resume section there)
    - media
        - recently read
            - books
            - articles
        - recently heard
            - podcasts

    - options:
        - contents might stay the same & it will be visible on all subpages
        - remove all together & find a new home for its current contents
        - contents stay the same for the welcome page but change sligthly for the other subpages
