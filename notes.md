## finish up:
- add a very light-blue-ish background like [this website](https://resume.framer.website/?via=onepagelove).
- add on the left-side
    - projects
    - leadership-and-affiliations
- media queries
    - on phone screen sizes
        - show website to fit the screen
        - right side should take entire space
- hide page source in browser

## things to do/improve:
- when the right-side moves to the bottom:
    - add a media query so that
        - all the text from the left side takes all available space
        - profile-overview is in the center in this layout
            - memoji
            - name
            - title
    - on phones
        - right-side's box takes the entire available screen but also has a consistent margin on its right
- sticky top navbar with links to
    - welcome
        - default
        - like a welcome, get to know me, and fun page
        - this page will continue to have the profile-overiew
