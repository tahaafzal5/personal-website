# Notes

## finish up:
- add a very light-blue-ish background like [this website](https://resume.framer.website/?via=onepagelove).
- hide page source in browser or disable right-click [link](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/25228476/how-to-hide-the-source-code-of-a-html-page)
- breakdown each section into its own page
- make ids into classes
- make proper use of ids
- add footer section
- make sure left-side takes all space on the left

## things to do/improve:
- when the right-side moves to the bottom:
    - add a media query so that
        - profile-overview is in the center in this layout
            - memoji
            - name
            - title
- sticky top navbar with links to
    - welcome
        - default
        - like a welcome, get to know me, and fun page
        - this page will continue to have the profile-overiew
    - resume (move all my resume section there)
    - media
        - recently read
            - books
            - articles
        - recently heard
            - podcasts

        - remove all together & find a new home for its current contents
        - contents stay the same for the welcome page but change sligthly for the other subpages
        - break right-side into top & bottom sections
