# Notes

## finish up:
- add a very light-blue-ish background like [this website](https://resume.framer.website/?via=onepagelove).
- add on the left-side
    - projects
    - leadership-and-affiliations
- media queries
    - on phone screen sizes
        - show website to fit the screen
        - right side should take entire space
- website should reload on the top always

## things to do/improve:
- when the right-side moves to the bottom:
    - add a media query so that
        - all the text from the left side takes all available space
        - profile-overview is in the center in this layout
            - memoji
            - name
            - title
- sticky top navbar with links to
    - welcome
        - default
        - like a welcome, get to know me, and fun page
        - this page will continue to have the profile-overiew
    - resume (move all my resume section there)
    - media
        - recently read
            - books
            - articles
        - recently heard
            - podcasts
- future of the right-side
    - contents might stay the same & it will be visible on all subpages OR
    - remove all together & find a new home for its current contents OR
    - contents stay the same for the welcome page but change sligthly for the other subpages
